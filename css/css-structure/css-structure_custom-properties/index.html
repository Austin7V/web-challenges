        <p>
          <em>Vulcan</em> was a theorized planet that some pre-20th century
          astronomers thought existed in an orbit between Mercury and the Sun.
          Speculation about, and even purported observations of, intermercurial
          bodies or planets date back to the beginning of the 17th century. The
          case for their probable existence was bolstered by the French
          mathematician Urbain
          <mark class="into-text-markirung">Le&nbsp;Verrier</mark> who, by 1859,
          had confirmed unexplained peculiarities in Mercury's orbit and
          predicted they had to be the result of gravitational influences of
          another unknown nearby planet or series of asteroids. A French amateur
          astronomer's report that he had observed an object passing in front of
          the Sun that same year led Le Verrier to announce that the long sought
          after planet, which he gave the name
          <mark class="into-text-markirung">Vulcan</mark>, had been discovered
          at last.

        <h2 class="content__info-title">Searching for Vulcan</h2>
        <p>
          Many searches were conducted for Vulcan over the following decades,
          but despite several claimed observations, its existence could not be
          confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The need for the planet as an explanation for Mercury's orbital
          peculiarities was later rendered unnecessary when
          <mark class="into-text-markirung">Einstein</mark>'s 1915
          <mark class="into-text-markirung"
            >theory&nbsp;of general&nbsp;relativity</mark
          >
          showed that Mercury's departure from an orbit predicted by Newtonian
          physics was explained by effects arising from the curvature of
          spacetime caused by the Sun's mass.

        <h2 class="content__info-title">References</h2>
        <p>
          Vulcan does not exist. The references below do exist, though.
          Especially the article by Isaac Asimov is a great read.
